Hi, In this post, I'm going to implement some of the typescript's built-in utility types from scratch. Why would I do this? Because I believe the best way to learn something is seeing what's going on under the hood.


## Pick
The [Pick](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#picktype-keys) is a utility type that picks only keys explicitly specified.

### Usage
```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

type PersonWithOnlyAge = Pick<Person, 'age'>; // { age: string }
```

### Do it yourself
```typescript
type MyPick<T, K extends keyof T> = {
  [k in K]: T[k]
}
```
